GD::Image::Scale2x - Implementation of the Scale2x algorithm for the GD library

This module implements the Scale2x algorithm (as well as 3x and 4x). From the Scale2x web site:

	Scale2x is real-time graphics effect able to increase the size of small bitmaps
	guessing the missing pixels without interpolating pixels and blurring the images.

The algorithm itself is explained at http://scale2x.sourceforge.net/algorithm.html. You can see
some example results by looking through the test directory.
